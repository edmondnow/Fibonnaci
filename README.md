Make a `50x50 grid`. When you `click` on one of the cells, there will be a `plus 1` for all cells in the row and column. When a cell was empty, it now becomes a `1`. After every change, the cell will shortly light up in `yellow`. When `5 consecutive` numbers in the `Fibonnacci` series are `next to each other`, the cells will `light up green` and will then be cleared.
